### About Penguin Lifelines

![Penguins Lifelines Logo](./penguin-lifelines.png)

Since 2009, the Penguin Lifelines project at the University of Oxford ([www.penguinlifelines.org](http://www.penguinlifelines.org/)) has sought to find novel solutions to the present data gaps, using satellite- linked cameras and genetic analysis. Together, these approaches have resulted in an integrated monitoring network that has the capacity to provide data to policy makers on areas particularly sensitive to fishing and human disturbance.

Our camera-monitoring program currently consists of 50 cameras throughout the Southern Ocean and along the Antarctic Peninsula, overlooking colonies of Gentoo, Chinstrap, Adélie, and King penguins. The cameras take images of the penguins year-round and are able to determine the health of the colony by obtaining nest survival rates while also observing novel behaviors, such as why and where penguins spend their winter months.

With the help of the Computer Vision laboratory at the University of Oxford, we are working to develop a recognition tool by which computers can automatically count every penguin individual in an image. By working at the fruitful interface of ecology and computer vision, we hope to improve the management of data from imagery and answer novel questions about wildlife dynamics that would otherwise be impossible.

### Why we need your help

We need your help annotating the hundreds of thousands of images taken over the past three years to turn images into numbers, which can then be used to answer novel questions about these penguin populations. By annotating the images, you are helping us to succeed in our project goals by obtaining quantitative data from photographs, which will directly improve our understanding of these species, while also assisting in their conservation. Your notations on the images will also aid in “training” a computer to automatically recognize penguin individuals. With your help, we hope that future image analysis can be automated for a range of species and speed up the lengthy data extraction process to produce near real-time results.

### Conservation

Ultimately, we hope that our research can directly feed into policy as we build evidence to determine important regions for penguins and highlight specific colonies of concern. There is growing support for Marine Protected Areas (MPA) at our study areas, which would protect penguins by restricting fisheries activities, but we must first fill in gaps in our understanding of the species distributions and behaviors.
