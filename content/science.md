Introduction
============

Currently, there are numerous serious threats to marine predators in the Southern Ocean: namely climate change, fisheries, and direct human disturbance. However, despite over a hundred years of study in the region, we have little baseline information against which to measure change. As we move away from scientific bases, less data is available on populations of predators and therefore huge gaps remain in our understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem.

As top predators, penguins are considered sentinels of changes within the ecosystem. Because they spend the majority of their life in water and fall at the top of the food chain, any changes to their populations may represent larger changes to the dynamic Antarctic ecosystem. We hope to measure these changes year-round at a large geographical range of study sites in order to better understand how threats to the ecosystem disrupt the dynamics of resident wildlife.

About Penguin Lifelines
-----------------------

![Penguin Lifelines](./penguin-lifelines.png)

Since 2009, the Penguin Lifelines project at the University of Oxford (www.penguinlifelines.org) has sought to find novel solutions to the present data gaps, using satellite-linked cameras and genetic analysis. Together, these approaches have resulted in an integrated monitoring network that has the capacity to provide data to policy makers on areas particularly sensitive to fishing and human disturbance.

Our camera-monitoring program currently consists of 50 cameras throughout the Southern Ocean and along the Antarctic Peninsula, overlooking colonies of Adélie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. The cameras take images of the penguins year-round and are able to determine the health of the colony by obtaining nest survival rates while also observing novel behaviors, such as why and where penguins spend their winter months.

With the help of the Computer Vision laboratory at the University of Oxford, we are working to develop a recognition tool by which computers can automatically count every penguin individual in an image. By working at the fruitful interface of ecology and computer vision, we hope to improve the management of data from imagery and answer novel questions about wildlife dynamics that would otherwise be impossible.

Why cameras?
------------

Camera technology affords us the ability to deploy ‘virtual ecologists’ in hard-to-reach areas, or in places where human presence might disturb wildlife and therefore disrupt their behavior. By establishing a camera network in the Southern Ocean, a region of the world with harsh conditions year-round, we hope to capture novel behaviors and study penguin populations that have never before been observed because of their remote locations.

However, along with the infinite possibilities of cameras as a monitoring tool comes an enormous amount of data in the form of hundreds of thousands of images. Each of our 50 cameras takes between 8 to 96 images daily throughout the entire year. In order to turn this massive database of information into a data set we can use to answer hypotheses, we need your collective help.

Why we need your help?
----------------------

We need your help annotating the hundreds of thousands of images taken over the past three years to turn images into numbers, which can then be used to answer novel questions about these penguin populations. By annotating the images, you are helping us to succeed in our project goals by obtaining quantitative data from photographs, which will directly improve our understanding of these species while also assisting in their conservation. Your notations on the images will also aid in “training” a computer to automatically recognize penguin individuals. With your help, we hope that future image analysis can be automated for a range of species and speed up the lengthy data extraction process to produce near real-time results.

Scientific Questions/ Project goals
-----------------------------------

Images provide the ability to ask and answer a range of questions depending on the location, study species, and the size of the colony. Although penguins are relatively well studied, the harsh Antarctic environment makes monitoring of wildlife difficult compared to other ecosystems. Therefore, to paint a better picture of future changes to colonies and populations, we hope to create a large-range monitoring network over many years of observation to answer big picture questions.

Specifically, we aim…

  * To determine changes in the timing of breeding of populations over time (eg. arrival and departure dates, hatching dates, incubation period, guard and post-guard periods).

![Breeding cycle](./breeding-cycle.png)

  _The annual life cycle of Chinstrap penguin, beginning with the summer breeding season where pairs mate, then incubate the eggs, followed by a period when chicks are closely guarded, and ending when chicks crèche, or form small groups away from their parents. After the adults moult, the penguins spend the winter months either at sea or on land._

  * To compare nest survival rates in between populations and determine whether low nest survival is linked to anthropogenic or ecological factors present near the colonies.

  * To reveal the rate of predation on chicks at each sites, the main predators and scavengers present, the peak timing of predation, and any mass predation events.
To determine whether particular colonies overwinter at breeding sites and if this behavior is mediated by the presence of certain sea ice types.

Conservation
------------

Ultimately, we hope that our research can directly feed into policy as we build evidence to determine important regions for penguins and highlight specific colonies of concern. There is growing support for Marine Protected Areas (MPA) at our study areas, which would protect penguins by restricting fisheries activities, but we must first fill in gaps in our understanding of the species distributions and behaviors. <!--Need more here.-->
