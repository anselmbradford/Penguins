  tutorial:
    welcome: 'Penguin Watch is a citizen science website trying to understand the lives of penguins. We want you to help us mark images taken from nesting sites around Antarctica.'
    marking: 'Individually mark penguins, chicks, and eggs in the image by clicking on the center of each one\'s visible area. Sometimes just a head or tail is showing, other times you\'ll be able to mark the center of the chest/torso. We sometimes need you to mark up to 30 of each&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and you can mark more if you want to.'
    removing: 'Click and drag marks to move them to the center of each animal. Remove any accidental marks using the black-and-white cross.'
    other: 'Mark any other animals too so we can see how often they are near the penguin nest.'
    talk: 'After classifying, you can discuss a specific image or the whole project with the science team and other volunteers by visiting Talk. You can also share your favorites with your friends!'
